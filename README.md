Bakti leverages a secure and scalable technology stack, combining blockchain, cloud services, and AI to deliver a transparent and Shariah-compliant charity platform. The architecture is designed to ensure seamless user experience, real-time donation tracking, and equitable fund distribution for both donors and recipients.

## Technologies Used:
